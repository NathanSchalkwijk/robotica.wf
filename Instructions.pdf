Open the menu (bottom/top left).
Go to preferences and open Raspberry Pi Configuration.
Go to Interfaces.
Activate VNC.
Once the Pi has booted up, click on the VNC logo in the bottom/top right of your screen.
On the left, you will see the Pi's IP address (which starts with 192. and varies on each Wi-Fi network). Note this down.
Open the terminal and type: git clone https://github.com/NathanSchalkwijk/robotica.wf.git [enter]
If you want to help test new versions, use:
Git clone https://github.com/NathanSchalkwijk/robotica-beta.git [enter]
When you have cloned the files from robotica.wf, we will start with the camera app.
Still in the terminal, type: cd robotica.wf [enter]
Then, type: sudo apt install cmake libjpeg9-dev [enter]
If the Pi asks for Y/N, type Y [enter]
Now, type: sudo apt install gcc g++ [enter]
Next, use: cd mjpg-streamer-experimental [enter]
Then, type: make [enter]
After that, type: sudo make install [enter]
Now, type: sudo /etc/rc.local [enter]
At the bottom of the file, before "exit 0", leave a line and type:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/pi/robotica.wf/mjpg-streamer-experimental [enter]
Below that, type:
/home/pi/robotica.wf/mjpg-streamer-experimental/mjpg_streamer -i '/home/pi/robotica.wf/mjpg-streamer-experimental/input_uvc.so -d /dev/video0 -r 1280x720 -f 15 -n -rot 90' -o '/home/pi/robotica.wf/mjpg-streamer-experimental/output_http.so -w www -p 8080' [no enter]
If this is a bit too difficult for you, you can ask someone, such as Nathan Schalkwijk/Ton Schuckman, for help.
Press [control x], then y and enter.
Now, type: sudo reboot [enter].
